# Data Stream Anomaly Detection

This project presents a Python-based solution for detecting anomalies within continuous data streams, focusing particularly on financial and system metrics. By employing the Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) statistical method, the script identifies unusual patterns, thus facilitating effective anomaly detection.

## Features

-Adaptive Thresholding: Automatically modifies thresholds according to recent data points, improving detection precision.

-Anomaly Detection Techniques: Implements the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for reliable identification of anomalies.

-Data Stream Simulation: Creates a simulated stream of floating-point numbers, introducing aspects like concept drift and seasonal variations.

-Real-time Data Visualization: Offers a live display of the data stream alongside any identified anomalies.
