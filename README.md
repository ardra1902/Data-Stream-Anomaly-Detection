# Data Stream Anomaly Detection

This project presents a Python-based Streamlit app for detecting anomalies in continuous data streams, especially in scenarios like financial and cybersecurity data monitoring. The application utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify unusual patterns in real time, making it a robust tool for proactive anomaly detection.

## Features

-Adaptive Anomaly Detection: Uses Isolation Forest to identify outliers in data streams dynamically.

-Data Stream Simulation: Generates synthetic data points to mimic a real-world data stream with elements of regular patterns, seasonal variations, and noise.

-Real-Time Visualization: Displays the data stream and flags anomalies in real-time, updating every second for a live monitoring experience.

-User-Configurable Parameters: Allows users to adjust the detection window size and contamination rate for better detection precision.
